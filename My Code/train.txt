1	participant 1: Hi, I want to run a graphical application from the command line, here is the script I wrote: https://paste8.com/4XQiHrXZ - it's Ubuntu Server 12.04 + Unity. What I get is an error from xhost "unable to open display :0" and from the graphical application I want to use (Sikuli) "Can't connect to X11 window server using ':0' as the value of the DISPLAY variable.". I've tried using DISPLAY:=1 as I use this number when connecting with a VNC client but it doesn't wo. rk either...	participant 2: is X running?	participant 1: I think so: https://paste8.com/HvhlT6vO.  maybe you prefer this check: https://paste8.com/0OhcBmfB	participant 2: these days you use lightdm (or gdm, kdm) to start X, so i'd try to kill what's there but unreachable with "sudo killall X" and then "sudo service lightdm start"	participant 1: what do I kill precisely? because it says "X: no such process"	participant 2: nothing, X wasn't running if you get that, proceed with "sudo service lightdm start" and then test your script	participant 1: alright but "start: Job is already running: lightdm"	participant 2: worm: try restart	participant 1: I did but I get "No protocol specified. " followed by "xhost: unable to open display :0" when executing my script (i.e. https://paste8.com/4XQiHrXZ). does it matter I run everything from a root tty? because that's what I do	participant 2: ahh, not a good idea to try to start X as root no.  now your regular users ~/.Xauthority file is probably owned by root, check that.  what does "ls -la ~/.Xauthority" give you?	participant 1: yes I got /root/.Xauthority I need to append an entry for my regular user right?	participant 2: check if your regular user still owns his .Xauthority file and remove the one for root	participant 1: there is no .Xauthority for my regular user I'm afraid	participant 2: well, copy the one from root to the user /home and make him own it, use the chown command.  sudo chown $USER:$USER $HOME/.Xauthority	participant 1: done, but running $sudo service lightdm start; returns "Sorry, user <myuser> is not allowed to execute '/usr/sbin/service lightdm start' as root on <myhost>."	participant 2: is the regular user in the sudoers?	participant 1: no, I believe I have to create a file in /etc/sudoers.d but I don't know the syntax yet	are you still running in root terminal? if so, try from a non-root one.. i've got to go prepare dinner so i'll be afk .. ask the channel for help on that, hope you get things up
